# Early Onset Heart Disease Predictor (IBM Z Datathon)
Heart Disease Predictor for the IBM Z Datathon uses Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to train a model on health data (age, sex, cholesterol, etc.) using Logisitic regression algorithms to obtain heart disease risk percentage and the consequent confusion matrix produced. The front-end is built with React and TypeScript, allowing users to input data and get real-time heart disease risk predictions based on the trained model.
